# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progress of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

(first week, hence we will explain about what we have done in the first week)
-   This week we worked on understanding GitHub and cloning from the master repository, learning the commands and  usage of pull, push, clone, commit and stage.
-   We also explored Lesson 3 to understand more and begin on the project (more below).
-   We did up wireframes for the data viewer & result viewer for both mobile & frontend.
-   Planned and schedules CA1 & 2 Project plans.

In addition to the above, referencing back to point 2, we have already started with the backend development and are close to completion on it. With a few more adjustments and fine tuning to do, our APIs and databse design would be set. We plan to add in possibly a few more additions such as an additiona column called Name so that is much more user friendly rather than just viewing a 10 digit participant ID.

Through the backend development alongside the tutorials provided by the Lecturer, we were able to understand the proper way to set up the backend with postgres and test it using the REST client. This was much easier than having to open up Postman in order to test the endpoints.

Related to the backend development, we also learnt a handful more about JS, for example, the usage of reduce and array mapping which is a lot more efficient.

We also learnt a few different method of queries, such as Parameterised Query which takes in values through a 2 dimensional array and if you require multiple inserts, you could use the array map method so it becomes $1....$8...etc depending on how many values to insert there are.

## What do I plan to do next week

Next week, we plan to have accomplished the foundation of the problem we will be working on, aim to complete about 30%.
-   Worked on justifications for wireframes, documentations for API, Database Schemmas, Problem Worksheet, Project worksheet & code style.
-   Start working on CA2.
-   Complete the backend completely (70% Done) and begin working on the front end

## Additional Thoughts

I am still quite not sure of the Limit & Offset when used in a query hence i would like to learn a bit more about that and if online resources do not aid in my understanding, i may seek the help of my lecturer.

This is a very interesting module, where we get to combine what we have learnt so far and put it into a somewhat 'industrial' use. Equipping us with the necessary skills.

We thought GitHub was more of just uploading and downloading files similar to how a ftp works but it is a lot more interesting and provides a very friendly environment for Developers. After reading an online source, i understood further about the Github merge. What i roughly understand is that it takes the commits, finds a common base and creates a new merge commit which is basically combining the changes. Github will be able to craft a merge algorithm on the spot that allows a smooth and successful merge. However, if the git encounters a data that has revisions/changes in both histories, it requires a user to review it and accept/deny/combine the changes accordingly. This is called version control conflict.

This is still just the tip of the iceberg, i would like to explore a lot more during the second week however, with the deadline of the assignment closing it, I may explore it once i feel we are on a more comfortable track. Most likely once we are done with backend and about 50% into frontend which i hope to achieve by end of Week 2!
