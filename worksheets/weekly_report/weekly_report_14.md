# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   We tested the Application and resolved some bugs that we could not detect earlier on.

-   We added in API error handling to ensure errors are caught correctly and returned appropriately.

-   Managed to get our caching to work, displays in the Table and also resolve a error where if the Database was not running it wouldn't pull from Cache. We resolved this through a third party module that sets a 'timeout' on the fetch.

-   Verified the API response.


## What do I plan to do next week

-   We plan to get ready for the Demonstration.

-   We plan to finish up the Documentations and push the update Wireframe(s).

-   Before submission, perform a final round of checks & conduct hosting.

## Additional Thoughts

-   One thing we could have improved on is pacing ourselves during the Phase 2 of the assignment. With the load from other modules, we find ourselves struggling and in a way 'burnt out', so i think in the future we should pace ourselves better to ensure we do not 'burn out'.

-   Apart from that, testing is very interesting. You will keep finding errors because without extensive user testing, as a developer you would miss out the bugs. The way developers test applications is actually quite vastly different from a end user that is not so tech savvy.
