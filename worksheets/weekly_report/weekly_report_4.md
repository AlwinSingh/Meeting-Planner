# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   We completed and did a final check on all documents
-   We worked on checking the codes are commented and the documentations are all done and ready for submission. 

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Plan to view through CA3 & CA4 to understand what is required of us first. 
-   If no questions, can start on phase 2 planning first.

## Additional Thoughts

-   We realise that the comments and code quality are important in terms of readability and understandability. Comments help each other to understand what the piece of code is doing and reduces the chances of miscommunication and time wasted on trying to figure out what a particular piece of code is doing. Understandability means the name of the variables etc must be well named so we understand what each function/variables is doing.
