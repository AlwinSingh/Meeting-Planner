# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Ironed out bugs & issues with the Web & backend of mobile

-   Improved the alogrithm

-   Fixed the response from the API as it did not match the requirement as specified in the documentation.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Next week we plan to review the backend again to ensure it is working fine

-   Test the Algorithm again with the completed Test Runner provided by the Lecturer

-   Perform caching for the Mobile Backend 

-   Finalise the Mobile Frontend and Backend so that we can proceed on to bug test and error handling.

## Additional Thoughts

-   Sometimes as we progress through the Assignment we tend to forget certain specifications or requirements specified in the documentation, hence i think it is better for us to abstract this information and keep it somewhere accessible so we can refer to it and always ensure we are on track.
