# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Tested the Algorithm using the backend test runner and encountered errors. Hence, the algorithm was rewritten.

-   Coded out the caching and are trying to make it work, at the moment we can print it out in the console but are unsure how to display it in the table.

-   Conducted a round of testing on the Mobile & Backend to iron out any outstanding issues that we may have missed.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   We plan to test the application all together (Mobile & Web).

-   Ensure caching works and handle the errors for it.

-   Improve the APIs' error handling and verify their response.

## Additional Thoughts

-  As we progress towards finishing the Assignment we realise that testing tends to be quite difficult as the code base gets more complex and you may lose track of certain parts of the code. Which is why consistent commenting is required!

-  I think our API response can be improved when errors are caught because we recalled back in CA1 Demo where the Lecturer informed us where we should place the error handling so that it is caught before pinging the Database.
