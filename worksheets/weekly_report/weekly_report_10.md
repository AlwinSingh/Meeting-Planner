# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

Last week i set up the following;
1. Basic / Adv Algorithm Draft 2
2. Set up backend endpoints (Basic / Adv Result Viewer & Adv Data Viewer)
3. Set up the frontend for Basic / Adv Result Viewer & Adv Data Viewer
4. Error Handling for backend & frontend
5. Mobile frontend

## What do I plan to do next week

Next week we plan to ensure all web features are fully functional and get it to be as error free as possible
We also plan to begin work on the mobile backend as well as explore the mobile UI elements through 3rd party packages. We plan to worked on 3rd Draft of Algorithm to see if we can further improve the algorithm to suit our needs. 

## Additional Thoughts

By delegating the work in such a way that we are not strictly dependent on one another, we are able to progress much faster.

We did up the 2nd Draft of Algorithm. It worked better than the 1st version so far. We have yet to fully test with the various test cases. We will be using the problem worksheet test cases as a reference guide. We worked on the frontend portion of the Mobile. We splitted it such that Kaifeng primarily worked on the frontend of the mobile whereas Alwin primarily worked on the backend of the mobile.

We worked on the frontend & backend for Advance data/resultviewer for the frontend to support the 2nd Draft of Algorithm.
