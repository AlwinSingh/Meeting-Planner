# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

We decided to take a break especially as we were done with Phase 1 and wanted a short period to rest before beginning on Phase 2.

## What do I plan to do next week

We decided to take a break especially as we were done with Phase 1 and wanted a short period to rest before beginning on Phase 2.


## Additional Thoughts

Taking short breaks before beginning on the next phase might actually be beneficial as it allows us to reflect on how to approach the next phase and think of any possible failures that we may have missed in Phase 1.
