# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progress of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

To slowly get back into the Phase 2 of the assignment after a 2 week break, we decided to explore the CA3 and CA4 brief which allows us to get a better idea of what to expect and achieve in the next Phase. We were also able to delegate the work so we know who does what.


## What do I plan to do next week

Next week we plan to begin on Phase 2, the initial planning and even beginning on some parts of the project to kick start the process.


## Additional Thoughts

Jumping straight back into Phase 2 of the assignment without reading the brief proper beforehand may have been detrimental as what we plan to achieve may not be in line with what is expected and some goals we set may not be realistic. This also gives us some time to slowly jump back into doing the assignment.
