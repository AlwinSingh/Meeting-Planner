# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

During my holidays (Week 8), i explored code planning before begining to code in Week 9. Through this, i realised that tradition pen and paper planning is much better, as it allows us to visualise the case model. The usage of each component before we code it in and the possible errors that require error handling. In addition to the code planning, i took into account delegating the work much better so that developement is not necessarily strictly dependent on the work of another developer. For example, if i work on frontend, i can utilise sample data rather than not work on frontend and having to wait for the other developer to finish the backend.

During my holdays (Week 8), I (Kaifeng) worked on the 1st Draft of the Algorithm. I implemented the basic logic first by running it internally in VSC using Node.js. Test cases I used for the programmes were the ones that were given out in the problem worksheet. 

## What do I plan to do next week

Next week, i plan to set up the backend endpoints and implement error handling for the new and existing endpoints. On top of that, attempt to begin work on the web & mobile frontend for the outstanding features. I also plan to work and check on bugs for 1st draft of Algorithm 

## Additional Thoughts

Code planning is actually shockingly helpful. I thought it would be a waste of time but it is actually superb. My thought flow is much better and i know what i'm doing, rather than having to take stops to ask myself, what should i do next or sometimes even....'What am i doing now!'

We managed to complete the 1st draft of Basic/Adv algorithm. However, there were some bugs that we have discovered that is caused by array being too big in size, we will be doing a 2nd draft which will be an improvement from the 1st Draft.
