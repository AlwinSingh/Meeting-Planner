# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week
-   We spent the last week finalising everything to ensure that everything works perfectly fine.
-   We hosted the backend on Heroku and the frontend on Github pages
-   We commented the codes.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   We plan to prepare on the presentation slides to prepare for the presentation
-   Prepare everything for submission
 
## Additional Thoughts

- Hosting is actually quite interesting and simple, it also helps to expand your audience for testing, you can ask your friends to test it without having them to access your localhost, etc. (Remote access)
