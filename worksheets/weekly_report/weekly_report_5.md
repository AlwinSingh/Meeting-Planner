# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Read up on all CA3 & CA4 document
-   Planned on our schedule and delegated the tasks

## What do I plan to do next week

-   We decided to take a break till week 7 (Resume week 8) to catch up with other modules and rest as well.

## Additional Thoughts

-   We realised that we had multiple ways of splitting and delegating our workload to make sure that everything is more of less balanced. In our scenario, Kaifeng plans to work on the first draft of the algorithm while Alwin will check the Data & Result Viewer submitted on CA1 & CA2.
