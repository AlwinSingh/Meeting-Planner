# Weekly Report

## What have I done last week

- Last week we worked on ensuring the functionality of our ADES Web. There were still quite a few bugs and issues to iron out hence we spent some time on ironing them out. There are still a few issues and bugs that are still present and are still working towards on resolving them.

- We also set up the mobile backend using React Native networking where we fetch from our endpoints. We learnt a lot about this part as we did not cover most of it during our Mobile Application Development last semester, especially the use of State and Props. We set up the endpoints and it was quite similar to how we would fetch it in our Phase 1 (Web Development). We then tested the backend through console log and the frontend was about to be tested through Mocky first.

- We also improved the algorithm and some elements to encourage user friendliness.

## What do I plan to do next week

- We plan to complete the mobile frontend and test it through Mocky.

- Integrate the frontend with the backend.

- Add in error handling for the frontend portion of the mobile, such as Input field(s), etc.

- Thoroughly test the application through the backend test runner as well as iron out some issues we already are aware of.

## Additional Thoughts

-  We plan to adjust some of the features of our applications as certain of them were not user friendly and after consulting our Lecturer, even though some of our APIs tend to have a slow response, we could resolve that by adding in a Loading Bar that we plan to add after we are done with the main issues we face now.
