# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week
Last week, we explored the fundamentals of Git (pull, push, clone, commit and stage) as well as a recap on backend & front end development.

We completed the back-end web development and connected it to the front end, with bugs & errors some of which we have already resolved this week.

We have updated the problem worksheet & done up the code_style.md for standardisation of code.



## What do I plan to do next week
- Do a last review of the wireframe
- More detailed wireframe justification
- Complete the front end
- Review error handling in the back-end & front end
- Review & Improve code (Possibly performance??)
- Complete all documentation

## Additional Thoughts

So far we feel like we are on pace, we can definitely catch up and patch whatever we have missing by mid of this week to ensure that the project is ready for submission.

We also would like to review our code and test it to resolve any loopholes or errors that we may have not encountered so far.
